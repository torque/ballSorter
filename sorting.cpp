// order and never attempts to optimize turn direction, even though the
// turntable should never have to turn farther than 512 potentiometer ticks
// (at least ignoring the fact that the tick count does not factor in the
// length of the dead zone). This could have been a large source of
// optimization, but I didn't get around to implementing it before the
// competition (other problems demanded more attention, as this one was only
// optimization and not related to overall functionality).
